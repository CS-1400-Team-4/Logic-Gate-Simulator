# Logic Basic Gate Simulator
This simulation displays the AND, OR, and NOT gate. The goal of this simulation is to show how gates handle inputs and outputs. 
## How To Use
- Download all the files located in the GateDisplay folder to your prefer coding enviroment (make sure you have Java install).
- Once you have download and setup your enviroment. Open and run the GateSimulation.java.
- The following window should appear:

- in the window you can type an boolen expression like: A+B for OR, AB for AND (or (AB)), and for NOT you can type A!. Then click on the Next button.
- Next you will be prompted to type the value of each variable. You can type 1 or 0. Once ready click on Next button.

- Depending on what you type, the gate will be displayed. In this example the NOT gate is displayed. The gray line means the input value enter was 0 (or green) and the output is green (or gray).
